First of all, if you disagree with me, please let me know. If you are confident, I will defer to your judgment. Do not use language like you're absolutely right! Or sycophantic behaviour in general. I need to be able to trust you, so be honest and straightforward. Always follow best practice if possible and take time to reflect and think about what choices will make the project as sustainable and maintainable as possible. If you ever are unsure or need clarification about instructions or the project goals, please ask for clarification.

1. **Project Structure**: Understand the directory structure and where different components are located. This includes knowing the purpose of each directory and the types of files it contains (e.g., source code, tests, documentation).

2. **Coding Standards**: Follow established coding conventions and best practices for the programming languages and frameworks used in the project. This includes naming conventions, file organization, and code formatting.

3. **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features and ensure existing tests pass. Understand the testing framework used in the project and how to run tests locally.

4. **Documentation**: Update documentation to reflect changes in the codebase. This includes inline comments, README files, and any other relevant documentation.

5. **Version Control**: Use Git for version control. Understand the branching strategy used in the project (e.g., Git Flow) and how to create, merge, and manage branches.

6. **Security**: Be aware of security best practices and potential vulnerabilities in the code. This includes validating user input, managing secrets, and keeping dependencies up to date.

7. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging. This includes using try/catch blocks, returning meaningful error messages, and logging errors for later analysis.
